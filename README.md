# FIR DApp

Traditional Paper based FIR Filing can be tampered easily and backdate entries are also possible, which really is a threat to 
the system. 

With FIR DApp, FIR is stored in Blockchain which makes it impossible to tamper and backdate entry. This brings transparency in 
the system, thereby developing the trust in the system. As there are many FIR tampering cases this will nullify those cases 
because it’s not feasible to tamper the FIR by altering the blocks.

• Smart Contract to store FIR on Ethereum Blockchain
• Client-side application to interact with the smart contract.

Dependencies
